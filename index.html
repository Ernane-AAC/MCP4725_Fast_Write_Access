   <h1>Fast Function to Write Samples in the MCP4725</h1>
   <div class="content1">
       <h2> Motivation </h2>
       <ul> 
          <li> Simple microcontrollers don't have a D/A converter as an internal peripheral, then the use of an external D/A converter with I2C protocol is very interesting, since the hardware scheme is easy to implement.</li>
		  <li> The MCP4725 is a low-power, high accuracy, single channel, 12-bit buffered voltage output Digital-to-Analog Converter.
          <li> Considering the Arduino Platform, there are several available libraries to communicate with the MCP4725, as instance,"Adafruit_MCP4725.h" and "MCP4725.h", or even a routine written with functions from the "Wire.h" library. </li>
		  <li> As the I2C is a serial communication protocol (slower than parallel transmission), the data transfer time is the one of bottlenecks when defining the sample rate for the signal generation in the MCP4725.</li>
          <li> In this page we will show the write access time of the MCP4725, considering the mentioned libraries, and propose a faster solution.</li>
       </ul>

        <h2> Distinct Library Functions and The Write Access Time </h2>   <!--This is a comment. Comments are not displayed in the browser-->
		<ul> 
          <li> The best way to define the sample rate to send samples to MCP4725 is to use a timer hardware interrupt, as instance, the Timer1 Overflow Interrupt. </li>
		  <li> Considering a constant sample vector, it is possible to store the samples in the program memory, where there are more space, or keep them in RAM memory, if the application uses a small amount of data. </li>
		  <li> In some applications the samples are calculated in real time, but this implies a significant computational burden. As the Atmega328P is a simple fixed point microcontroller, only simple calculations can be executed for a given sample rate. In the presented example, the samples are calculated in real-time, implying a limited sample rate (2kHz). </li>

	    <h3> Notes </h3>
		<ul> 
		  <li> The square pulses present in the oscilloscope figures are relative to the signal on pin PB0 (Arduino UNO), and were obtained considering a sampling rate of 2kHz and an I2C clock of 400kHz. The pulse widths are proportional to the duration of the process of writing a sample to the MCP4725. See the instructions to set and clear (toggle) the PB0 bit in the code snippet. </li>
          <li> The libraries "Adafruit_MCP4725.h",  "MCP4725.h" and "Wire.h" use the hardware interrupt of TWI, then if a MCP4725 write function is included in an ISR (Timer 1 Overflow ISR, as instance), it is necessary to enable the global interrupt flag inside of the ISR, otherwise the code won't work. The Atmega328P disables the global interrupt flag when an interrupt is acknowledged, as default. </li>
          <li> The proposed function presents the lowest write cycle time among the presented options. In this case, it is not necessary to enable the global interrupt flag within the ISR.</li>
		  <li> The default clock speed for the TWI is 100kHz in the libraries "MCP4725.h" and "Wire.h", so change it to 400kHz, if it is the case.</li>
		  <li> The proposed function uses the "Fast Mode Write Command" of the MCP4725 (see MCP4725 Datasheet). Some modifications are required to perform other write or read commands.</li>

        <h2> Waveform Generation - Sampling Rate of 2kHz</h2>
		<ul> 
		  <li> Assuming a 50Hz sine waveform, any of the writing options on the MCP4725 can be used for a 2kHz sampling rate. The sampling rate can be higher if the sinusoid samples are previously calculated and inserted into a vector in memory. In the presented example, the samples are calculated by the ISR.</li>
		  <li> All codes generate the same sine waveform shown in Fig. 6. </li>
		  <li> The square pulses shown in Figs. 7 to 10 represent the time duration of the ISR (calculations plus MCP4725 writing). The sample calculation takes around 170 microseconds to be executed (CPU clock at 16MHz).</li>

          <li> Considering the version 4 of the code, the sampling rate was doubled, generating the result of Fig. 11, where we observed a better definition of the signal. It is not possible to run code from versions 1 to 3 at this sample rate.</li>
          <li> As we can see in Fig. 12, the maximum speed for real-time execution has been reached, so it is not possible to increase the sample rate in this strategy. To do this, one option would be to use previously calculated samples, avoiding the calculation within the ISR. </li>
          <li> For generating more complex signals with real-time calculation, or using higher sampling rates, a faster platform should be considered.</li>
